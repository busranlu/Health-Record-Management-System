Prescription Verification System
Purpose: The dApp aims to create a secure and transparent platform for verifying prescriptions issued by doctors and filled by pharmacies. This helps prevent prescription fraud and ensures patients receive the correct medication.

How It Works:
User Registration: Doctors, pharmacies, and patients register on the platform with verified credentials.
Prescription Issuance: Doctors issue digital prescriptions on the blockchain, which are encrypted and timestamped.
Prescription Verification: Pharmacies access the blockchain to verify the authenticity and validity of prescriptions before dispensing medication.
Access Control: Patients can view and manage their prescriptions securely.
Immutable Records: All transactions related to prescriptions are immutable and auditable.

Scenario Comparison:
Scenario 1: Using Scroll Blockchain
Advantages:
Privacy: Scroll's zero-knowledge proofs ensure privacy for sensitive prescription data.
Scalability: Scroll's architecture supports high transaction throughput.
Efficiency: Lower transaction costs compared to Ethereum.
Disadvantages:
Adoption: Scroll is a newer blockchain, so adoption may be lower compared to Ethereum.
Ecosystem: Limited developer tools and community support compared to Ethereum.

Scenario 2: Using Ethereum Blockchain
Advantages:
Ecosystem: Robust developer tools, documentation, and community support.
Interoperability: Ethereum's widespread adoption allows integration with other dApps.
Security: Ethereum's mature network offers strong security features.
Disadvantages:
Scalability: Higher transaction fees and slower processing compared to Scroll.
Privacy: Ethereum's transparency may pose privacy challenges for sensitive prescription data.
Choice and Justification:

For the Prescription Verification System dApp, I would choose Scroll Blockchain for several reasons:
Open-Source: As an open-source project, Scroll allows for transparency, flexibility, and community-driven improvements which are beneficial for long-term project sustainability.
Privacy: Scroll's zero-knowledge proofs provide enhanced privacy for prescription data.
Scalability: Scroll's architecture supports higher transaction throughput at lower costs.
Focus: Since the dApp deals with sensitive health data, privacy and scalability are crucial factors that Scroll addresses effectively.
